  <figcaption>Ikebana (生け花, 活け花, "arranging flowers" or "making flowers alive") is the Japanese art of flower arrangement.[1][2] It 
    is also known as Kadō (華道, "way of flowers"). The tradition dates back to the 
    7th century when floral offerings were made at altars. Later, they were placed in the tokonoma (alcove) of a home.</figcaption>
